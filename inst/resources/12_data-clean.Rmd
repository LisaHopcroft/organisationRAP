## Data cleaning

_In this section, please implement any data cleaning techniques. Ensure that these run end-to-end without any manual intervension._

_Rather than use mappings embedded in the code, add them in a separate text or csv file and read them in from there (this will make it easier to update later._

_Document the following:_

- _where any mappings came from_
- _justification of any cleansing techniques (e.g. identification of outliers, removal of records with critical data missing)_

```{r}
